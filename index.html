                    Recently, I led a program to accelerate innovation on PayPal's payments team. I outlined the specific research driven problem areas within the larger organization's product development lifecycle. Together, the team created a set of agents and prototyping tools using Replit, Cursor, Lovable, ChatGPT, Claude to solve for those pain points. These pilots have produced real quantitative and qualitative results:

                <ul class="specialty-list">
                    <li>Time was saved on a 2 hour task for content designers by 80% by creating an agent that submits UK Consumer Duty compliance reviews.</li>
                    <li>Other pilots changed the way we think about our design process altogether, a prototyping tool that instantly designs with design system components making the design and build process seamless.</li>
                    <li>Decision making is made faster with prototyping that brings ideas for apps out of static frames and into interactive experiences that any stakeholder can tangibly test on their own devices, at scale. Making the review, identifying edge cases, and stakeholder alignment faster.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="section-content">
                    Using Cursor, I created a custom <a href="https://capacity-planning-2.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">capacity planner</a> that helps teams understand the demand from a product roadmap, scope, and analyzes it against current capacity. Every product team is different, and the levers can make one designer slow will vary. So I included weighting that can be adjusted so give teams a more realistic view of their unique situation. This gives a clear understanding of the likely risks in different scenarios giving product leaders a thoughtful way to make informed decisions fast.

                    Through expert facilitation - I facilitate productive and efficient leadership teams through strategic planning, OKR development, and retrospectives. I bring systems thinking and use this to build frameworks, rubrics, and activities that set the stage for leaders to roll up their sleeves and get on the same page.

                    I can take your swirling unorganized team and quickly help them to find their north star, align, and prioritize. I can help product owners get their ill defined objectives, hypothesis and help them craft a concise problem statement designers are excited to design solutions.

                <p class="section-content">
                    In my career, I've held roles as a content designer and product manager. I have led design, product and engineering teams. I can understand enough of the nuance of everyone's roles because I have held most of them myself at some point. So when everyone on a team has one hand on the elephant, I can help them see the whole beautiful beast.
