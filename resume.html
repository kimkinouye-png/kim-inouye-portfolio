                I'm a strategic operations leader who specializes in driving excellence and transformation across large, complex organizations. Over the past 12 years, I've built the operational infrastructure that helps creative and technical teams execute at enterprise scale—from translating business strategy into measurable outcomes to implementing scalable frameworks and OKR systems that actually work. Most recently, I've been focused on AI transformation, helping 300+ person teams navigate how to adopt and govern these new tools responsibly.
